Include bibliography moving forward.

I really appreciate the detailed comments. This lets me know that you know what is going on and are following what the authors are doing, plus this is useful when you need to make an extension. I know this is the first replication, but in the future if something isn't working, take a bit of time to figure out why. If you don't know what something is doing or can't figure out how to make it work, you should ask in Slack or during office hours. Omitting large parts of the replication doesn't help you learn and also makes it hard to grade.
